% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
The reinforcement learning algorithms work well with well-defined rewards, but fail with sparse/deceptive rewards and require additional exploration strategies. This work introduces a deep exploration method based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bonus. The proposed method can be plugged-in the actor-critic algorithms that use deep neural networks as a critic. Based on the conclusion of the regret bound of under the Linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) approximation, we use the Feature Matrix to calculate the UCB bonus for deep exploration. The proposed method is equivalent to the count-based exploration method in special cases and is more suitable for general situations. Our method uses the last d-dimension feature vector in the critic network and is easy to deploy. We design a simple task ``Swim'' to demonstrate the principle of the proposed method to achieve exploration in sparse/deceptive reward environments. And we do more empirical evaluation on sparse/deceptive reward version gym environments. The evaluation results verify that the proposed algorithm can perform effective deep exploration in sparse/deceptive reward tasks.
